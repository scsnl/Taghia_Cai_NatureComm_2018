Load-dependent ROIs were determined on the contrast of interest: 2-back vs 0-back, including 9 load-positive (2-back > 0-back) ROIs: bilateral anterior insula (AI), bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral frontal eye field (FEF), bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and 2 load-negative (2-back < 0-back) ROIs: ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Each ROI was 6-mm radius sphere centered at the corresponding peak voxel. 

Here are the ROI coordinates in MNI space:
Node, x, y, z
lAI, -32, 24, 2
rAI, 36, 22, 0
lMFG, -42, 24, 30
rMFG, 40, 36, 34
lFEF, -26, 2, 58
rFEF, 30, 10, 56
lIPL, -46, -44, 44
rIPL, 52, -40, 50
PCC, -12, -56, 16
VMPFC, -2, 48, -8
DMPFC, 4, 16, 50
